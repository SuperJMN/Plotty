# Plotty
## A custom architecture, compiler and virtual machine

This is **Plotty**, a side-project that I've made just for **The Fun Of LearningÂ®.** 

It features a custom architeture (Plotty) that can be programmed using the C language. 

## It has Compiler!
The compiler is the star of this programmed. It's coded from scratch in C#. The AST is generated with the help of [Superpower](https://github.com/nblumhardt/superpower).

## Superpower? What's that?

It's a very interesting and powerful library by [Nicholas Blumhardt](https://github.com/nblumhardt) to build parsers easily in .NET. You have to take a look at it ASAP.

## It's also a virtual machine

Plotty has an emulator of a (Plotty) virtual machine. It runs the code generated by the compiler. How else would you run the code? :)

There are projects in the solution to visualize the execution of the code. 
The main application is a Universal Windows Application:
